**Note** This post IS NOT sponsored, the thoughts and opinions are my own. 

Noise is all around us but for some, me included it can be triggering, when there are lots of conversations going on or the room is really loud it makes me anxious and uneasy. An example of this would be a really busy office or a play barn - a play barn is like a jungle gym, up until recently I would put my Air Pods in and just listen to music in these situations, but that made it hard to hear when people were talking to me so I started looking around for alternatives, that is when I found Loop. 

### What the heck is loop?

Loop are ear plugs designed to allow you to control the enviroment around you so that you can bring the volume down to a more controlled level OR mute it out altogether with their mute bud. 

I didnt go for the mute bud specifically but rather the experiance pro bud which does come with two mute inserts, the pro reduces the enviromental noise by 18-20db across the entire frequency spectrum.

In the box you get;

 - 1 set of Loop Experience Pro
 - 4 sets of silicone ear tips (XS, S, M, L)
 - 3 sets of foam ear tips (S, M, L)
 - 2 sets of Loop Mute (add-on for 5dB more noise reduction)
Carry case

### The Buds

The buds come in this carry case which is perfect for carrying around everywhere, it is however a bit fiddly, if you walking and want to put the buds in, I find myself stopping to pop them in else they would be on the ground.

I went for the gold ones, which look pretty cool right?

### My Experiance

So far, the buds are amazing, they form part of my daily carry, they go straight into my pocket in the morning and stay there for the entire day, if the enviroment gets too loud I just pop them in and the sharpness of the room gets taken right off. 

They also look pretty stylish in the ear too, it starts more of a conversation than anything else, once people know why they are there it brings an awareness to the fact that I don't really like the noise and what effect it has. 

I am also able to still hear what is going on around me so if someone is like "Hey Rich, do you know..." I can answer rather than them have to shout me 15 times over the sound of Metallica drowning out the room.

### Any Issues?

If I had one thing to say and this isn't anything to do with the bud itself but when I wear them I can hear my own voice when I talk and it is difficult to regulate how loud I am talking, some people have to ask multiple times what I have said becuase I am talking too quiet becuase in my head the voice is so loud. 

Also the supplied case is possibly the only other gripe, there is nowhere to put the additional filters and the case that comes with the buds is really small.
