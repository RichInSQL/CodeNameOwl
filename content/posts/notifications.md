This week is mental health awareness week here in the U.K. this had me thinking that I would like to share my journey on living with anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD.

### Undiagnosed ADHD?

I am sure you are thinking, what do you mean Rich, undiagnosed ADHD, how do you know you have ADHD if it isn't diagnosed? Well...I don't but I have a lot of the symptoms one would have if they were diagnosed with ADHD.

### What's your story? 

What my story? That might be a lot to put out to the world in one post but I have had Anxiety for as long as I can remember, that is actually a lie I think I first started getting flutters of anxiety when I was 8 or 9 I would worry about things people wouldn't normally even think about and then obsess about it sometimes for hours or days. 

Over the next 10 years, the anxiety would come and go, it would be ok and under control for a long period of time and then I would get a period of intense anxiety and when I say intense I mean it would make me physically sick if I wasn't able to manage it.

I got my own house just after I was 30 years old, things were great for a really long time then as everyone knows covid-19 came and it turned my world upside down. The anxiety was as as worse as it had ever been, I was unable to eat out of fear of being sick things just got worse as time went on. 

Fast forward a few month and here we are, back at the beginning, focussing on myself and my family to get myself back into the place I was a few years ago. 

### Why are you doing this? 

This blog? One of the things I see alot of, especially on Instagram is mental health pages with a focus on girls, dont' get me wrong this is absoloutley amazing but I would have loved to find someone, a blog or something I could connect with to know that what I was going through wasn't abnormal so I hope this blog will help someone else boy or girl know that they are not weird or alone. 

### Okay Bye

The one thing I will say is, don't expect content to be freuqent or on a schedule here, I will be posting when I feel like it or have something to say, if I don't have anything to say I won't be posting anything for the sake of clicks, I want this blog to be somewhere people can come to and connect on a personal level - I don't and won't be posting for clicks, ever!

Speak Soon, Rich
