For some cooking and food is a staple of their lives an enjoyment but for me I find it really stressful, it makes me anxious to the point where I don't cook anything becuase the stress of deciding what to cook is too much to bare, the overwhelm of options around what to eat makes it hard to actually decide what I want.

Over the last five months or so I have been playing around with ways to make cooking and planning meals that little bit less stressful and I wanted to share that with you. 

### Planning

One of the key tips you always hear to getting on top of meal times is plan plan plan but the thing I find hard was knowing what is in the cupboards and what is going to go with the meals I fancy.  

I would always come in from work and fret about what is in the cupboards, it would flare my anxiety up and I would just give up and eat junk so that I have something in my belly. This would go on for a few days and I would end up creating a problem around food worrying I was going to worry it became a nightmare.   

### Subscription Boxes

With all this in mind, the thing that has worked for me is a subscription box, here in the U.K. there are a few options, Hello Fresh, Mindful Checf, Gusto etc. but for me Gusto has been the one I have been using for a while and it has changed the game surrounding meal times. 

Each week you are presented with a list of options on either the mobile app or website depending how you view your account, these options can be filtered based on whatever meets your dietry requirements, be that plant based, vegetarian or a meat eater. 
Once the options for the week ahead are selected there is literally nothing else you have to do, on the selected delivery day your box will arrive, all the ingrediants measured and arranged into bags that match the recipie cards, the recipie cards have numbers on you see so that you can pair them up with the ingrediant bags if anything comes that needs to be chilled or frozen they are packaged into a special section of the box to ensure that they are kept nice and cold.

The other great thing is that if there are any problem with the delivery, the team at Gusto are on hand to get it sorted, I have had a few items that have arrived a bit damaged and while Gusto can't do anything there and then they do give some money back so I can get to the shops and replace what is broken or damaged. 

### The Cooking

Cooking the meals sent from Gusto is an absoloute breeze, this was the one part of meal times that I absoloutley hated, even bulk cooking meals in advance had the same effect, there are just so many options, what can I use from the cupboards, do I have everything I need the stimulation always became too much and as I said at the start I would just give up.
With the subscription box option the recipie cards can be sorted into an order of what you fancy on what day, then on that day you grab the ingrediant bag which contains all the little sauces or garnishes and just start cooking. 

I don't find this method anywhere near as overwhelming or stressful, everything is planned out in a nice order that I can follow and understand, the ingrediants are all measured and if I happen to cut the veggies wrong or make a mistake along the way it isn't a big deal becuase nothing really needs to be done a certain way. 

### Wrap Up

So, for me a subscription box is definatley something that helps with my mental health, it helps me plan out the meals in advance knowing that what I need for each recipie is going to be available when it comes to cooking and I know I am getting a good well balanced diet which is also super important.
