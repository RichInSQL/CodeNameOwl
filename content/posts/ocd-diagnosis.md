I had a telephone assesment today, its been a long journey of being passed around and I know it is early days but it seems that I might have OCD or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. 

As part of the assesment that I took part in today I had to take a test, at the end of the test you get a score which has a range that is deemed as an acceptable cut off, if you fall below this range you more than likely don't have OCD anything above that range and you are showing symptoms that indicate you might have OCD, this cut off is 40, I came out with an 84 which is almost double the accepted range. 

I have to say I felt a sense of relif knowing that I might have an answer to some of what I have been feeling my entire life, knowing that my anxiety is attributed to something other than just "worries" seems to have really bought some kind of calm. 

Looking back over the years a lot of what I have experianced in my life makes actual sense now, as a child I would obsessivly worry about washing my hands, I wouldn't eat anything until my hands were washed, during the pandemic this was for good reason forced down our throats posters like this

were EVERYWHERE - I dont know for sure but it looks like it bought up a lot of old obsessions which then just feed anxiety. 

I know this is only the beginning and I don't think there will ever be a time when I am 100% better, there will still, like anything be ups and downs but knowing what I am aiming at now has given me a clearer picture on what might be "wrong" with me.
